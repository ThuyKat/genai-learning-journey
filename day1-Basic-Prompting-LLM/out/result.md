Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the age difference:** When you were 4, your partner was 3 times your age, meaning they were 4 * 3 = 12 years old.
2. **Calculate the age gap:** The age difference between you and your partner is 12 - 4 = 8 years.
3. **Determine your partner's current age:** Since the age difference remains the same, your partner is currently 20 + 8 = 28 years old.

**Therefore, your partner is now 28 years old.**
