The provided text doesn't explicitly detail the training process of Gemini 1.5 Pro. However, it does offer some clues:

*   **Mixture-of-Experts Architecture:** The model uses a "mixture-of-experts" architecture. This implies that the model consists of multiple sub-networks (the "experts"), and a gating mechanism determines which experts are activated for a given input. This architecture is known for its ability to scale model capacity efficiently.
*   **Advances in Training and Serving Infrastructure:** The text mentions "major advances in training and serving infrastructure." This suggests that Google has developed new techniques or systems to handle the computational demands of training such a large and complex model.
*   **Multimodal:** The model is multimodal, meaning it's trained on and can process different types of data (text, video, audio). This requires a training process that can effectively integrate information from these diverse sources.
*   **Long Context:** The model is designed to handle extremely long contexts (up to 10M tokens). This likely involves specific training techniques to ensure that the model can effectively learn and retain information over such long sequences.
*   **Efficiency:** The model is described as "highly compute-efficient," suggesting that the training process was optimized to minimize the computational resources required.
*   **Scaling:** The text mentions scaling to millions of tokens and continued improvement in predictive performance. This implies that the training process was designed to take advantage of large amounts of data and scale effectively.

In summary, while the exact details are not provided, the training process likely involved:

*   Training a mixture-of-experts model on a massive dataset of text, video, and audio.
*   Using advanced training infrastructure to handle the computational demands.
*   Employing techniques to enable the model to effectively process and retain information over extremely long contexts.
*   Optimizing the training process for computational efficiency.
