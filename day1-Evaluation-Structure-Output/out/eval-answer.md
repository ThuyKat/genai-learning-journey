STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness, completeness, and fluency according to the criteria.

The response mentions that the model performs strongly on code tasks. While the document does mention the model's ability to learn and translate a new language, it doesn't explicitly state its performance on code tasks. This could be inferred, but it's not directly stated.
The response is grounded in the document, as it refers to the model's ability to learn and translate Kalamang.
The response does not fully answer the question, as it only provides one aspect of the model's capabilities.
The response is fluent and easy to understand.

STEP 2: Score based on the rubric.

Based on the evaluation, the response is mostly grounded and somewhat answers the question, but it could be more complete and directly relevant to the prompt. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3.
