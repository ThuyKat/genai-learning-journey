Okay, imagine you have a puppy! You want to teach your puppy to sit.

**Training is like teaching your puppy to sit:**

1. **Show the puppy what "sit" means:** You say "sit" and gently push the puppy's bottom down.  This is like giving the computer lots of examples of what you want it to learn.  For example, if you want the computer to recognize cats, you show it lots and lots of pictures of cats.

2. **Reward the puppy when it does it right:** When the puppy sits, you give it a treat and say "Good sit!" This tells the puppy it did a good job.  The computer also gets a "reward" when it gets something right.  This reward is usually a small adjustment to its "brain" (which is really just a bunch of numbers) to make it more likely to do the right thing next time.

3. **Correct the puppy when it does it wrong:** If the puppy doesn't sit, you try again. You might say "No, sit" and try again.  If the computer gets something wrong, it also makes a small adjustment to its "brain" to try and avoid making the same mistake again.

4. **Keep practicing!** You keep showing the puppy what "sit" means, rewarding it when it does it right, and correcting it when it does it wrong.  You do this over and over and over again.  The computer also needs to see lots and lots of examples and make lots and lots of adjustments to its "brain" before it gets really good.

5. **Eventually, the puppy learns to sit on its own!** After lots of practice, the puppy will sit when you say "sit" without you having to push its bottom down.  The computer also learns to recognize cats (or whatever you're teaching it) on its own, without you having to tell it what to do every time.

So, training is just showing something (like a puppy or a computer) lots of examples, rewarding it when it does things right, and correcting it when it does things wrong, until it learns to do it on its own!
