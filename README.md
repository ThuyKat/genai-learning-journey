Day 1 covers setup and hands-on experimentation with the Gemini API using Python. Key activities include client configuration, single and multi-turn model prompts, response controls, Markdown output logging, and practical error handling for rate limits. The focus is on building a reusable workflow for generative AI experiments and capturing reasoning in a clear, documented format.
